# Overview of School District Analysis


We will be assisting another Data Scientist by the name of Maria in analyzing data on standardized test scores and school funding. Maria would like us to assist in analyzing this data in order to give insights on performance trends and patterns. These insights will be used by the school’s superintendent and other administrators to make informed decisions at the school and district level. 

# Results

After analyzing the data, we have created several Data Frames to better view and process the information. 

### Average Math Score by grade

### Average Reading score by grade

### School Performance based on budget per student

### School Performance based on type of school

*	How is the district summary affected?
*	According to the Data in out Top 5 Schools and Bottom 5 Schools Data Frames we can determine that overall performance was affected more by school type and population size than budget size.
    (Insert TOP 5 and Bottom 5 Charts!!!!!!!)
*	As you can see the top 5 schools are all smaller charter schools while the bottom 5 schools are all district schools. 
*	How is the school summary affected?
*
*	How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
*There is very little change in math and reading scores after replacing all 9th grade reading and math scores with NaN; the overall difference in less than .1% in math and less than .2% in reading.
*	Average math goes from 83.41% to 83.35%
*	Average reading goes from 83.85% to 83.89%
*	Passing math percentage goes from 93.27% to 93.18%
* Passing reading percentage goes from 97.31% to 97.02%
*	Overall passing percentage goes from 90.95% to 90.63%
*	Total school budget and Per Student Budget were not affected by the change of grades. 
*	Thomas High School remains in second place performance wise regardless of 9th grade reading and math scores.
